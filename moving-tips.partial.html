                    Moving Tips
                </div>
                <p>We strive to make your moving process as comfortable as possible, so here is some advice from us.</p>
                <p>The main tip is to relax and not to think of moving as a disaster that you have to overcome. People move houses and offices many times in their lives, so there is nothing complicated in moving, especially if you use professional services and plan such activities in advance.</p>

                    <li>
                        <div>Area Rugs</div>
                        <p>Order professional cleaning for your area rugs before your move. They will be returned rolled, wrapped, and ready for packing. Plus, it will be really pleasant to unroll them in your new flat, house, or office.</p>

                        <div>Furniture</div>
                        <p>Take everything from your cupboard, shelves, closets, etc. before movers arrive. Don't try to demount furniture on your own â€” just make sure specialists can move it safely.</p>

                    <li>
                        <div>Houseplants</div>
                        <p>Don't water your houseplants before moving. Also, it's better to wrap them in kraft paper or transparent cellulose to prevent any damage.</p>
